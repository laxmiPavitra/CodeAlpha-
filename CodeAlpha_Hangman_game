TASK-1 🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

📌 Project Overview This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed using Python. The player must guess a hidden word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. The game runs entirely in the console and is designed for beginners to understand core programming concepts.

🎯 Objective To guess the randomly selected word correctly before running out of attempts.

✨ Features Uses a predefined list of 5 words Random word selection using the random module Allows one-letter input at a time Maximum of 6 incorrect attempts Displays progress with underscores (_) for unguessed letters User-friendly messages for correct, incorrect, and repeated guesses

🛠️ Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Concepts Applied: Random module While loop If-else conditions Strings and lists User input and output

▶️ How to Run the Project

Make sure Python is installed on your system.
Copy the code into a .py file (for example: hangman.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the file using the command: python hangman.py
🎮 How to Play

The game selects a random word from the list.
You must guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
You win if you guess all letters correctly.
You lose if all 6 attempts are used.
🏆 Winning Condition All letters in the secret word are guessed correctly before attempts reach zero.

💀 Losing Condition Attempts become zero before guessing the full word.

📚 Learning Outcomes Understanding loops and conditionals Handling user input validation Working with lists and strings Implementing simple game logic in Python

Program:
import random

# List of predefined words
words = ["apple", "python", "cloud", "happy", "world"]

# Choose a random word
secret_word = random.choice(words)
guessed_letters = []
attempts = 6
print("🎮 Welcome to Hangman Game!")
print("Guess the word letter by letter.")
# Game loop
while attempts > 0:
    # Display current progress
    display_word = ""
    for letter in secret_word:
        if letter in guessed_letters:
            display_word += letter + " "
        else:
            display_word += "_ "
    print("\nWord:", display_word)

    # Check if player has guessed the word
    if all(letter in guessed_letters for letter in secret_word):
        print("\n🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the word:", secret_word)
        break

    # Take input
    guess = input("Enter a letter: ").lower()

    # Validate input
    if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():
        print("❗ Please enter a single alphabet letter.")
        continue

    # Already guessed check
    if guess in guessed_letters:
        print("❗ You already guessed that letter. Try another.")
        continue

    guessed_letters.append(guess)

    # Check guess
    if guess in secret_word:
        print("✔ Good guess!")
    else:
        attempts -= 1
        print("❌ Wrong guess! Attempts left:", attempts)

# Loss condition
if attempts == 0:
    print("\n💀 Game Over! The word was:", secret_word)

Output:
🎮 Welcome to Hangman Game!
Guess the word letter by letter.

Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ 
Enter a letter: w
❌ Wrong guess! Attempts left: 5

Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ 
Enter a letter: h
✔ Good guess!

Word: _ _ _ h _ _ 
Enter a letter: p
✔ Good guess!

Word: p _ _ h _ _
Enter a letter: y
✔ Good guess!

Word: p y _ h _ _
Enter a letter: t
✔ Good guess!

Word: p y t h _ _
Enter a letter: o
✔ Good guess!

Word: p y t h o _
Enter a letter: n
✔ Good guess!

Word: p y t h o n

🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the word: python
