🤖 Built a Basic Rule-Based Chatbot using Python
📌 Overview
This project implements an advanced rule-based chatbot using Python.
The chatbot interacts with users through predefined commands and responds using simple decision-making logic.

🎯 Objective
To build a chatbot that simulates basic conversation using conditional statements without using AI or machine learning.

✨ Features
Supports greetings (hello, hi, hey)
Responds to common questions
Displays a command menu
Tracks number of user messages
Graceful exit with conversation summary

🛠️ Concepts Used
Functions
Loops
Dictionaries
Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
Input / Output handling

▶️ How to Run
python chatbot.py

💬 Sample Commands
hello
how are you
menu
help
bye

📚 Learning Outcome
Understand rule-based chatbot design
Practice Python control structures
Improve logical thinking and code organization.

Code:
#chatbot
def chatbot():
    # Display welcome message and instructions
    print("🤖 Welcome to the Basic Chatbot!")
    print("You can type the following commands:")
    print("- hello / hi / hey")
    print("- how are you")
    print("- what is your name")
    print("- help")
    print("- bye (to exit the chat)\n")

    # Infinite loop to keep the chatbot running
    while True:
        # Take input from the user, remove extra spaces, convert to lowercase
        user_input = input("You: ").strip().lower()

        # Check if the user entered nothing
        if user_input == "":
            print("🤖 Chatbot: Please type something.")

        # Greeting responses
        elif user_input == "hello":
            print("🤖 Chatbot: Hi! Nice to meet you.")

        elif user_input in ["hi", "hey"]:
            print("🤖 Chatbot: Hello there!")

        # Respond to well-being question
        elif user_input == "how are you":
            print("🤖 Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks for asking!")

        # Respond to name query
        elif user_input == "what is your name":
            print("🤖 Chatbot: I am a simple rule-based chatbot.")

        # Help command to guide the user
        elif user_input == "help":
            print("🤖 Chatbot: Try saying hello, ask how I am, or type bye to exit.")

        # Exit condition
        elif user_input == "bye":
            print("🤖 Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day 😊")
            break  # Exit the loop and end the program

        # Default response for unknown inputs
        else:
            print("🤖 Chatbot: Sorry, I don't understand that command.")

# Call the chatbot function to start the program
chatbot()

Output:
🤖 Welcome to the Basic Chatbot!
You can type the following commands:
- hello / hi / hey
- how are you
- what is your name
- help
- bye (to exit the chat)

You: hi
🤖 Chatbot: Hello there!
You: how are you
🤖 Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks for asking!
You: help
🤖 Chatbot: Try saying hello, ask how I am, or type bye to exit.
You: bye
🤖 Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day 😊
