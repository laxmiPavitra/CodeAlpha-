I'm exited to work on this 1 month internship 
🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed using Python. The player must guess a hidden word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. The game runs entirely in the console and is designed for beginners to understand core programming concepts.

🎯 Objective
To guess the randomly selected word correctly before running out of attempts.

✨ Features
Uses a predefined list of 5 words
Random word selection using the random module
Allows one-letter input at a time
Maximum of 6 incorrect attempts
Displays progress with underscores (_) for unguessed letters
User-friendly messages for correct, incorrect, and repeated guesses

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Concepts Applied:
Random module
While loop
If-else conditions
Strings and lists
User input and output

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a .py file (for example: hangman.py).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file using the command:
python hangman.py

🎮 How to Play
1. The game selects a random word from the list.
2. You must guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
5. You win if you guess all letters correctly.
6. You lose if all 6 attempts are used.

🏆 Winning Condition
All letters in the secret word are guessed correctly before attempts reach zero.


💀 Losing Condition
Attempts become zero before guessing the full word.

📚 Learning Outcomes
Understanding loops and conditionals
Handling user input validation
Working with lists and strings
Implementing simple game logic in Python
