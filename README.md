TASK-1
🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed using Python. The player must guess a hidden word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. The game runs entirely in the console and is designed for beginners to understand core programming concepts.

🎯 Objective
To guess the randomly selected word correctly before running out of attempts.

✨ Features
Uses a predefined list of 5 words
Random word selection using the random module
Allows one-letter input at a time
Maximum of 6 incorrect attempts
Displays progress with underscores (_) for unguessed letters
User-friendly messages for correct, incorrect, and repeated guesses

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Concepts Applied:
Random module
While loop
If-else conditions
Strings and lists
User input and output

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a .py file (for example: hangman.py).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file using the command:
python hangman.py

🎮 How to Play
1. The game selects a random word from the list.
2. You must guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
5. You win if you guess all letters correctly.
6. You lose if all 6 attempts are used.

🏆 Winning Condition
All letters in the secret word are guessed correctly before attempts reach zero.


💀 Losing Condition
Attempts become zero before guessing the full word.

📚 Learning Outcomes
Understanding loops and conditionals
Handling user input validation
Working with lists and strings
Implementing simple game logic in Python

TASK-2
📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker (Python)

📌 Project Overview
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a simple Python-based console application that helps users calculate their total stock investment. The program uses predefined stock prices and allows users to enter stock names and quantities to compute the overall investment value.

🎯 Objective
To calculate the total investment value of a stock portfolio based on user input and fixed stock prices.

✨ Features
Uses a hardcoded dictionary for stock prices
Accepts user input for stock names and quantities
Calculates individual and total investment values
Displays a clear portfolio summary
Optionally saves the portfolio details to a text file

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Key Concepts Applied:
Dictionary
Input and Output operations
Basic arithmetic calculations
While loop
File handling (optional)

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the program code in a file (e.g., stock_tracker.py).
3. Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
4. Run the program using:
python stock_tracker.py

🎮 How It Works
1. The program displays available stock prices.
2. The user enters a stock name and quantity.
3. The investment value is calculated using predefined prices.
4. The user can add multiple stocks.
5. When finished, the program displays the total investment value.
6. The result is saved in a .txt file for future reference.

📊 Sample Stock Prices Used
AAPL – ₹180
TSLA – ₹250
GOOGL – ₹140
AMZN – ₹130
TATA – ₹160

📚 Learning Outcomes
Understanding dictionaries in Python
Performing arithmetic operations
Handling user input effectively
