📊 Sample Stock Prices Used AAPL – ₹180 TSLA – ₹250 GOOGL – ₹140 AMZN – ₹130 TATA – ₹160

📚 Learning Outcomes Understanding dictionaries in Python Performing arithmetic operations Handling user input effectively

Program:
# Hardcoded stock prices
stock_prices = {
    "AAPL": 180,
    "TSLA": 250,
    "GOOGL": 140,
    "AMZN": 130,
    "TATA": 160
}

total_investment = 0
portfolio = {}

print("📈 Welcome to Stock Portfolio Tracker")

while True:
    stock = input("Enter stock name (or 'done' to finish): ").upper()
    
    if stock == "DONE":
        break

    if stock not in stock_prices:
        print("❌ Stock not available.")
        continue

    quantity = int(input("Enter quantity: "))

    investment = stock_prices[stock] * quantity
    total_investment += investment
    portfolio[stock] = quantity

    print(f"✔ {stock} added. Investment: ₹{investment}")

print("\n📊 Portfolio Summary")
for stock, qty in portfolio.items():
    print(f"{stock} - {qty} shares at ₹{stock_prices[stock]} each")

print("\n💰 Total Investment Value: ₹", total_investment)

# Optional: Save to file
with open("portfolio.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Stock Portfolio Summary\n")
    for stock, qty in portfolio.items():
        file.write(f"{stock} - {qty} shares\n")
    file.write(f"\nTotal Investment: ₹{total_investment}")

print("\n📁 Portfolio saved to portfolio.txt")

Output:
📈 Welcome to Stock Portfolio Tracker
Enter stock name (or 'done' to finish): TATAL
Enter quantity: 160
✔ TATAL added. Investment: ₹25600
Enter stock name (or 'done' to finish): TSLA
Enter quantity: 250
✔ TSLA added. Investment: ₹62500
